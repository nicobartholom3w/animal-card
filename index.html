			<p>The Holland Lop is a dwarf rabbit, which means it should weigh about 4 lbs. once fully grown. They have a wide, short body, consequently giving them a compact body shape. They pose similarly to a cat, resting mostly on their hind legs and only slightly on their two front ones. Their most famous feature is their large fur-covered ears which fall on either side of their heads.</p>
